## HoloFunk
**Hololive Funkin'** (Officially shortened to HoloFunk) is a modpack for Friday Night Funkin' built on Kade Engine, featuring multiple song replacements up to and including Week 4, character asset replacements, and more goodies.

# The Cast So Far (ALTERNATIVE CAMPAIGN)
 - **Fubuki Shirakami** (Replacing Boyfriend)
	 - A fox girl who is not only a member of hololive's first generation of VTubers, but also the first member of a four-girl unit called hololive GAMERS. A few weeks after the start of the Main Campaign, Fubuki was hired by a disguised Daddy Dearest to track down a burglar who apparently stole something precious from his wife, and is following the footsteps of Aloe and Nene to do so.
	 - She has a friendly disposition and a number of short-skit videos on Twitter and Youtube, and likes to try out games from several different genres.
 - **Mio Ookami** (Replacing Girlfriend)
	 - A "FAQing cute" wolf girl who is part of the hololive GAMERS unit alongside Fubuki. She is often described as mature and responsible by fans and hololivers alike, and this along with other qualities gives her a motherly sort of aura that hasn't gone unnoticed by the fanbase. She was asked by the rest of GAMERS to keep Fubuki out of trouble the fox girl is on the hunt for the 'necklace thief'.
 - **Calliope Mori** (Week 1)
	 - Her songs include "Live Again" (Live Again - Bopeebo Remix), "RAP" (失礼しますが、RIP♡ - Fresh Remix), and "Calli Battle" (Off With Their Heads - Dad Battle Remix).
 - **Gura Gawr and Amelia Watson** (Week 2)
	 - Their songs include "Sharkventure" and "Mythbuster" (Misteavous Myth-Buster).
 - **HAACHAMA** (REPLACING MONSTER)
	 - HAACHAMA CHAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA-
 - **Botan Shishiro** (Week 3)
	 - In lieu of tracks closely associated with her, her songs are simple covers of Pico's songs, dubbed "Botan" (Pico Remix), "La-Lion" (Philly Nice Remix), and "Poi" (Blammed Remix).
 - **Coco Kiryu** (Week 4)
	 - Her songs include "Friday Night" (Cover), "Cinderella" (24 Hour Cinderella Cover), "Gangimari" (Gangimari Dragon), and "Hands" (Cover).

# Features

 - **New Input System**
	 - An improved input system, similar to Quaver or Etterna, with less delays, less dropped inputs and other improvements.
 - **More information during gameplay**
	 - While you're playing, we show you information about how you're doing, such as your accuracy, combo break count, notes per second, and your grade/rating.
 - **Customizable keybinds**
	 - Instead of being forced to use WASD and the arrow keys, you can customize the keybinds to any keys you want!
 - **Replays** (in beta)
	 - Have you ever gotten a crazy score but didn't record? The replay system solves that: it automatically saves a "replay" of your gameplay every time you complete a song, which you can play back inside of the game. 
	 - Replays just store information about what you're doing, they don't actually record the screen -- so they take up way less space on your disk than videos.
 - **Audio offset**
	 - If your headphones are delayed, you can set an offset in the options menu to line the game up with the delay and play with synced audio like intended.
